== Datasource

=== Add sniffy to classpath

In order to intercept the SQL queries executed by your application you should use Sniffy datasource wrapper.
At first you should add `sniffy.jar` to classpath of classloader which loads actual driver.
If your datasource is created by application server and registered in JNDI for later usage, you should copy `sniffy.jar`
 so it would be available by application server common classloader.
For example in case of `Apache Tomcat` you should place it to `<TOMCAT-HOME>/lib` folder

=== Enable sniffy for datasource

In order to enable sniffy on a datasource, just add `sniffy:` prefix and use `io.sniffy.sql.SniffyDriver` as a driver class name.
For example `jdbc:h2:~/test` should be changed to `sniffy:jdbc:h2:mem:`
The Sniffy JDBC driver class name to `io.sniffy.sql.SniffyDriver`
