Sniffy can be configured globally using Java system properties or environment variables.
This configuration can be overriden in `web.xml` and/or `@EnableSniffy` annotation - see appropriate sections of documentation.

WARNING: sniffy configuration is parsed only once and any changes made to system properties or environment variables in run-time won't have any effect on `Sniffy`

Sniffy filter can also be enabled or disabled using HTTP query parameters and/or HTTP headers.

If Sniffy filter is currently disabled you can enable it by adding `?sniffy=true` query parameter to your request -
it will enable the sniffy for current request and will also set a `sniffy` cookie which will enable sniffy on subsequent requests.

For stateless clients who don't maintain the cookie jar it might be more convenient to enable/disable Sniffy using `Sniffy-Enabled: true` / `Sniffy-Enabled: false` headers.
Unlike the query parameter the HTTP header will only affect a single request.

A similar header `Sniffy-Inject-Html-Enabled` can be used for hiding or showing the Sniffy Widget in the browser.
Unlike `Sniffy-Enabled` It doesn't come with a query parameter alternative.

Convenient https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sniffy-chrome-extension/hmiejljajpgikfbajggcolnblbhfedjp?hl=en[Sniffy Chrome Extension] can add these headers by simply clicking on an icon in your Google Chrome browser.
